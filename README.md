# GVI_Extraction
# We applied existing segmentation models from mmlab to predict street view due to:
# 1. The existing segmentation models are very mature with high accuracy while training new models is not that necessary.
# 2. Our data covers multiple cities in east, central, and west USA, the street views differ in different cities, and one trained model based on one or all city street views still has inaccuracies and is difficult to apply to all cities, the effects would be like applying models trained by Cityscape dataset.
